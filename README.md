#SAVANGER HUNT

The Scavenger hunt is an application that will assist the tourists visiting Bahrain to schedule a proper plan under the given budget. The main idea of developing the app is to aid the tourists and simplify their work in finding places in Bahrain and forming a schedule under the minimum possible budget. This way tourists can easily and efficiently form a proper day to day plan during their visit to Bahrain.

Project Objectives

The major objective of this application is to provide aid for people planning vacations in Bahrain. To fulfil our main objective, we have thoroughly researched on the existing applications that are used by tourists, and the advantages and disadvantages are collected, and the advantageous features are chosen to implement into the application by minimizing the disadvantages of those existing systems. Moreover, the application focuses on improving the interface and making it highly user friendly. The primary features included in this application are needed to organize and scheme a detailed plan for any user, planning a trip under a given budget. The system will increase the efficiency of planning a trip and makes sure that the user does not overspend for just visiting a few places in Bahrain. 
To achieve this objective, in this project, we will analyze and study the problems faced by any individuals planning trips to Bahrain and provide an optimized solution that will help them to form an efficient and effective trip plan.
1.	The analysis and study of various systems that are currently present and served in the same field.
2.	The analysis and study of several efficient algorithms that produce effective results.
3.	An optimized solution is proposed that serves an individual travelling to Bahrain with the ability to plan and form a proper schedule.
